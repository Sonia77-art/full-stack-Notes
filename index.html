      <h3>BATHING</h3>
      <p>Bathing should be a relaxing experience. As newborns, pups enjoy being licked by their mothers, so take a few
        pointers from mama dogs. First, make sure the water is warmed to body temperature (like mother’s saliva). Mama dog does not splash her pup, so neither should we. Gently pour water over the pup, starting with the torso
        and moving to the feet. Use a damp cloth to wash the face without getting water in the pup’s eyes.</p>
